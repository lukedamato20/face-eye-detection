# Fast Frontal Face and	Eye	Detection

This	project	is concerned with	fast frontal face and	eye	detection	using the	Viola-Jones	object detection method.

- Obtain	a	dataset	containing	faces	and	non-faces	and	use	OpenCV	to	train	a	Cascade	classifier.	OpenCV	have	a	user	guide	to	help	you	get	started.	Present	and	discuss	your	results	in	the	evaluation	section	of	your	report. 
- Obtain	frontal	face	and	eye	cascades	from	here:	https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades.	Write	a	program	which uses	these	two	cascades	to	detect	
faces	and	eyes	in	images	you	input	to	the	program.	Faces	should	be outlined	with	a	green	rectangle,	and	eyes	should	be	outlined	in	red.	For	this	artefact,	use	your webcam to	do	real-time	video face	and	eye	tracking	(if	you	donâ€™t	have	a	webcam, you	can	use	prerecorded	videos	taken	with	your	phone).
